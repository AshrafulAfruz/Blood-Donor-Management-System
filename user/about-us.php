        <p><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);  font-size: 14px; text-align: justify;"></span> </br></br>Universally, 'Blood' is recognized as the most precious element that sustain life. It saves innumerable lives across the world in a variety of conditions. Once in every 2-seconds, someone, somewhere is desperately in need of blood. More than 29 million units of blood components are transfused every year. The need of blood is great. </br></br>Despite the increases in the number of donors, blood remain in short supply during emargencies, mainly attributed to the lack of information and accessibility. We believe this tool can overcome most of these chalenges by effectively connecting the blood donors with the blood receipent.</br> </br> We are trying to made searching blood for patients easy. We are constantly managing this site and collecting information of donors who are intested to donate blood. Our database is growing day by day from which people can easily search blood donors.</br></br>Founder<br>Md Ashrafuzzaman Khan</br>Bloodforces</p>
